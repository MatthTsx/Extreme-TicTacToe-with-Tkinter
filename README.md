<h4>The "Velha velhada" software can be used to play the classical TicTacToe or a expanded one, whereas the user can change the quantity of squares and the winning factor (amount needed for one to win).</h1>

<h3>How to Win:</h4>
<p>The player must have a difference of n squares from the other player in one of this directions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Columns</li>
  <li>Rows</li>
  <li>Diagonals</li>
</ul>
<sub>the n amount corresponds to the winning factor variable, in which the minimal can't be below the amount of side Squares. <br/>
Thus, n is the minimal between the <strong>Squares</strong> and <strong>WinFactor</strong> constants inside src/main.py</sub>
